# Macro-Project
This project takes 5 years of ATVI stocks and has an analysis using R. We found this data and decided to do basic summary statistics, linear regression (residuals vs fitted, normal q-q, scale-location, and residuals vs leverage), and plotted two moving averages for the stock price for all days since 2017. We wanted to use Blizzard-Activision as we enjoy Blizzard games, and the company has had some issues in the recent years that would be interesting to show with data. All of us had done some research on what we should do for this project, and we agreed that using R would be beneficial. We found that in 2019 ~ there was a sharp decrease in the closing price, which could be due to the Hong-Kong issue and delays on key games.
